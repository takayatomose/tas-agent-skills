description: Debug an issue with structured root-cause analysis before changing code.

Help me debug an issue. Clarify expectations, identify gaps, and agree on a fix plan before changing code.

1. **Gather Context** — If not already provided, ask for: issue description (what is happening vs what should happen), error messages/logs/screenshots, recent related changes or deployments, and scope of impact.
2. **Search Historical Issues** — Run `tas-agent memory search "<error message or symptoms>"` to check if this issue or a similar one has been solved before.
3. **Clarify Reality vs Expectation** — Restate observed vs expected behavior. Confirm relevant requirements or docs that define the expectation. Define acceptance criteria for the fix.
3. **Reproduce & Isolate** — Determine reproducibility (always, intermittent, environment-specific). Capture reproduction steps. List suspected components or modules.
4. **Analyze Potential Causes** — Brainstorm root causes (data, config, code regressions, external dependencies). Gather supporting evidence (logs, metrics, traces). Highlight unknowns needing investigation.
5. **Resolve** — Present resolution options (quick fix, refactor, rollback, etc.) with pros/cons and risks. Ask which option to pursue. Summarize chosen approach, pre-work, success criteria, and validation steps.
6. **Remember the Fix** — After successful resolution, run `tas-agent memory store` to document the root cause and the fix for future reference.
