description: Scaffold feature documentation from requirements through planning.
---

Guide me through adding a new feature, from requirements documentation to implementation readiness.

1. **Gate In (MANDATORY)** — Run `tas-agent memory search "<feature name>"` to identify existing related requirements or architectural patterns.
2. **Capture Requirement** — If not already provided, ask for: feature name (kebab-case, e.g., `user-authentication`), what problem it solves and who will use it, and key user stories.
3. **Create Feature Documentation Structure** — Copy each template's content (preserving YAML frontmatter and section headings) into feature-specific files:
   - `docs/ai/requirements/README.md` → `docs/ai/requirements/feature-{name}.md`
   - `docs/ai/design/README.md` → `docs/ai/design/feature-{name}.md`
   - `docs/ai/planning/README.md` → `docs/ai/planning/feature-{name}.md`
   - `docs/ai/implementation/README.md` → `docs/ai/implementation/feature-{name}.md`
   - `docs/ai/testing/README.md` → `docs/ai/testing/feature-{name}.md`
4. **Requirements Phase** — Fill out `docs/ai/requirements/feature-{name}.md`: problem statement, goals/non-goals, user stories, success criteria, constraints, open questions.
5. **Design Phase** — Fill out `docs/ai/design/feature-{name}.md`: architecture changes, data models, API/interfaces, components, design decisions, security and performance considerations.
6. **Planning Phase** — Fill out `docs/ai/planning/feature-{name}.md`: task breakdown with subtasks, dependencies, effort estimates, implementation order, risks.
7. **Documentation Review** — Run `/review-requirements` and `/review-design` to validate the drafted docs.
8. **Gate Out (MANDATORY)** — Use `tas-agent memory store "Feature Design: <Name>" "<Key Architectural Decisions and Requirements Summary>"` to capture the state of documentation into memory.
9. **Next Steps** — This command focuses on documentation. When ready to implement, use `/execute-plan`. Generate a PR description covering: summary, requirements doc link, key changes, test status, and a readiness checklist.
