description: Iterative Quality Assurance focused on rapid feedback and acceptance testing for incremental changes.
---

Follow this workflow to verify each delivered increment against its specific acceptance criteria.

1. **Gate In (MANDATORY)** — Run `tas-agent memory search "<feature context>"` to retrieve previous QA results and test patterns.
2. **Acceptance Testing** — Systematically verify each Acceptance Criterion (AC) defined in the requirements phase. Use factories or mocks to generate the specific data needed for the story's scenarios.
2. **Automated Regression Safety** — Run targeted integration tests to verify that the new increment correctly integrates with existing modules without breakages. Perform a focused request-based test (E2E) of the new feature increment.
3. **Feedback & Correction** — Identify any defects introduced. Fix immediately within the same iteration. Briefly assess if the increment caused obvious performance regressions (e.g., slow queries).
4. **Evidence & Sync** — Record successful completion of criteria. Update test documentation and README/docs to reflect the final "as-built" implementation.
5. **Final DoD Sign-off** — Confirm the story is "Done" and ready for deployment or the next iteration.
6. **Gate Out (MANDATORY)** — Run `tas-agent memory store "QA Summary: <Feature Name>" "<Summary of Test Results, Coverage, and Found Bugs>"` to update the quality history.
